A list of physics data in csv format

Free Fall 
This dataset was created by dropping an object from multiple heights. The objective was to find the acceleration of gravity.

Static friction
The experiment was conducted by setting a 0.1143 kg block on a table, connect to a force gauge. Mass was added to the block and was pulled. The peak force was recorded.

Kinetic friction.
The experiment was conducted by setting a 0.137 kg block on a table, and connecting it to another 0.1 kg mass hanging off the edge of the table by a pulley. The hanging mass was enough that it caused the block to always slide over a measured distance of 0.3 m. Extra mass was added to the block on the table, and the time it took to travel the 0.3 m was recorded.
