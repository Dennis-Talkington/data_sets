A list of physics data in csv format

Free Fall 
This dataset was created by dropping an object from multiple heights and recording the time of fall.
Objective: Determine the acceleration of gravity.

Static friction
The experiment was conducted by setting a 0.1143 kg block on a table, connect to a force gauge. Mass was added to the block and was pulled. The peak force was recorded.
Objective: Determine the coefficient of static friction between the block and the table.

Kinetic friction.
The experiment was conducted by setting a 0.137 kg block on a table, and connecting it to another 0.1 kg mass hanging off the edge of the table by a pulley. The hanging mass was enough that it caused the block to always slide over a measured distance of 0.3 m. Extra mass was added to the block on the table, and the time it took to travel the 0.3 m was recorded.
Objective: Determine the coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the table.
